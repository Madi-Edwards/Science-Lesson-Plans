## About the Collection

Madison Edwards was a fourth grade teacher for six years. Over the six years, one of her favorite subjects to plan and teach was science because of the fun, hands-on activities she often got to do with her students. This collection contains ten weeks of science lesson plans from the 2021-2022 school year, geared towards 4th grade students. The topics include ecosystems, animal adaptations, human health and nutrition, fossils, moon phases, and much more.
